      subtitle: "Biosensor Validation",
      text: "Our results suggest that the addition of the inducer released TtgR to a certain extent, but the sensitivity was not strong enough. And the resources used for growth are more than used for protein expression, resulting in a faster increase in cell density than the increase in fluorescent protein expression. We are trying to investigate the optimal conditions for intracellular protein expression by varying the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and adjusting the culture temperature. The design and successful construction of a high-throughput screening system combining directed evolution with a biosensor allowed efficient screening of CHS mutants. This method significantly improved screening efficiency compared to traditional approaches, facilitating the rapid identification of effective CHS variants. However, longer mutation validation pathways increase the complexity of mutation library construction. Also, more intermediates may mean less efficient production of the product. This places higher demands on the sensitivity of the sensor. Although progress was made in enzyme expression, there is still a need to balance the metabolic flux within the synthetic pathway. Adjusting the expression levels of different enzymes, avoiding intermediate accumulation, could further enhance production yield. The current TtgR-based biosensor demonstrated limited sensitivity in detecting naringenin, affecting the effectiveness of high-throughput screening. Future work could involve protein engineering to enhance TtgR specificity for naringenin or explore other more sensitive biosensors to improve screening efficiency. V.natriegens showed a tendency to prioritize growth over target protein expression, which may limit product yield. Optimizing medium composition, adjusting induction conditions, or using metabolic engineering to redirect resources towards target product synthesis could further improve production efficiency. This study provided an effective way of improving CHS through an innovative highthroughput screening method combining directed evolution and biosensors. This approach not only enhanced screening efficiency but also showcased the potential of V. natriegens as a chassis organism for industrial production. However, achieving more efficient and scalable production will require further research and optimization in metabolic pathway regulation, biosensor performance, and cultivation strategies.",
