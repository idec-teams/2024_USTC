      subtitle: "Sakuranetin and Naringenin",
      text: "Sakuranetin (4,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone) is a compound that belongs to dihydroflavonoid. In plants, it is synthesized from the precursor substance naringenin and exists as a phenolic plant antitoxin. In recent years, sakuranetin have been widely reported for its multiple pharmacological benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimycobacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-Leishmania protozoan, anti-trypanosomal, glucose uptake stimulation, neuroprotective, antiretroviral generation, and antitumor properties. Today, most flavonoids are synthesized either by direct extraction from plants or by chemical methods. Therefore, direct extraction is limited by plant growth conditions and unstable biomass supply for continuous production of flavonoids. Moreover, the two existing methods of extraction are costly and cannot reach a large scale. Biosynthesis, as a highly potential production method, has been reported in articles using chassis such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organisms, but the yield is still a long way from reaching the requirements of industrial production. As reported, this pathway is limited by the condensation reaction of p-coumaroyl coenzyme A with three molecules of malonyl-CoA, which is catalyzed by chalcone synthase. Optimization of the enzymatic profile of chalcone synthase becomes critical for improving yield. When considering how to optimized the pathway to maximize the output, we use several methods in our design: to use the enzyme with high catalytic activity, and to increase the protein expression level by using codon optimized coding sequence and high-efficient promoters.

      subtitle: "Vibrio natriegens",
      text: "V. natriegens is a Gram-negative marine bacterium with a fast growth rate of 15.61 ± 0.18 min in the logarithmic phase, compared with 27.23 ± 0.69 min for E. coli cells. Compared with common chassis organisms such as yeast and E. coli, V. natriegens has a faster growth rate, a broader substrate spectrum, superior substrate uptake and an abundant number of ribosomes in the cell, which contributes to its excellent exogenous protein expression ability, so V. natriegens is a new type of chassis cell that has been developed in the field of biotechnology and synthetic biology in recent years. Based on its excellent biological properties, a variety of natural products and proteins, such as L-DOPA（引文1）, melanin（引文2）, c-type cytochromes（引文3） and other substances, have been efficiently biosynthesized in V. natriegens. Moreover, Vibrio exhibits robust applicability to commonly used synthetic biology parts. The synthetic biology tools for the V. natriegens are maturing, which shows further promises. ",

      subtitle: "Biosensor",
      text: "In the directed evolution process, high-throughput screening is the main bottleneck. Biosensors offer the benefits of high sensitivity, real-time monitoring, and efficiency properties. Previous flavonoid product assays have relied on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), biosensor also eliminates the need for purification of cultures as well as enrichment. A variety of promoters can further alter the sensitivity of biosensors by modulating protein expression. In this study, we choose to express the TtgABC-TtgR system from Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E in V. natriegens, and it can reflect the product concentration in real time and efficiently. ",
