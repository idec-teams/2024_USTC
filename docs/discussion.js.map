But this genetic algorithm doesn’t show the convergence of the optimization result, as it should theoretically, with the increasing numbers of iterations. However, if only one parameter is chosen as a factor affecting the fitness, a converged result is obtained when the number of iterations reaches a certain threshold. We tried to optimize the algorithm by, for example, adding the weigh to the values in the step of changing the fitness assigned by comparison with the optimal model, as well as by adjusting the probability of occurrence of the variance to minimize the possibility of the emergence of a locally optimal solution. However, we did not end up with the desired convergence curve and the number of differential bases of the sequence remained within a stable range of values. This means that the algorithm is susceptible to small perturbations, and it is difficult to quantify and judge the impact of the setting of the probability of variation on the overall program.\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      text: [{text:\"Overall, the design and successful construction of a high-throughput screening system combining directed evolution with a biosensor allowed efficient screening of CHS mutants. This method significantly improved screening efficiency compared to traditional approaches, facilitating the rapid identification of effective CHS variants.  However, longer mutation validation pathways increase the complexity of mutation library construction. Also, more intermediates may mean less efficient production of the product. This places higher demands on the sensitivity of the sensor. Although progress was made in enzyme expression, there is still a need to balance the metabolic flux within the synthetic pathway. Adjusting the expression levels of different enzymes, avoiding intermediate accumulation, could further enhance production yield. The current TtgR-based biosensor demonstrated limited sensitivity in detecting naringenin, affecting the effectiveness of high-throughput screening. Future work could involve protein engineering to enhance TtgR specificity for naringenin or explore other more sensitive biosensors to improve screening efficiency. \"},{em:\"V.natriegens \"},{text:\"showed a tendency to prioritize growth over target protein expression, which may limit product yield.
