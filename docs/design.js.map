The main synthetic pathways commonly used for naringenin are the phenylalanine pathway and the tyrosine pathway. In the phenylalanine pathway, the step from the substrate phenylalanine to pcoumaric acid is catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid 4hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL). In contrast, in the tyrosine pathway, tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) catalyzes the direct conversion of tyrosine to 4-coumarate, bypassing the C4H intermediate. For heterologous protein expression systems, going through as few steps as possible is the best way to minimize the accumulation of intermediates and their associated effects. Another barrier was that C4H, which is a membrane-bound P450 monooxygenase, could not be functionally expressed in bacteria. Therefore, we ultimately chose the tyrosine pathway for naringenin production. To synthesize sakuranetin, Omethyltransferase 3 (OMT3) is needed.
